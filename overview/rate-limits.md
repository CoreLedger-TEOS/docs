# Rate Limits

A rate limit is the number of API calls a consumer can make within a given time period. If this limit is exceeded or if CPU or total time limits are exceeded, the consumer may be throttled. API requests made by a throttled consumer will fail.

All API requests are subject to rate limits. TEOS API requests are subject to [Platform Rate Limits](rate-limits.md#platform-rate-limits).

Real time rate limit usage statistics are described in headers that are included with most API responses once enough calls have been made to an endpoint. Once a rate limit is reached, any subsequent requests made by your app will fail and the API will return an error code until enough time has passed for the call count to drop below the limit.

### Platform Rate Limits <a href="platform-rate-limits" id="platform-rate-limits"></a>

TEOS API requests made with an [api key](../authentication.md#api-key) or [user access token](../authentication.md#user-access-token) are counted against that tenant’s rate limit. A tenant’s call count is the number of calls it can make during a rolling twenty-four hour window and is defined as follows:

`Calls within twenty-four hours = 10000`

#### Headers <a href="headers" id="headers"></a>

Endpoints that receive enough requests from your app will include a `X-Rate-Limit-Limit`, `X-Rate-Limit-Remaining` and `X-Rate-Limit-Reset` HTTP headers in their responses. The headers will contain strings, describing current application rate limit usage.

**Header Contents**

| Key                      | Value Description                                |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `X-Rate-Limit-Limit`     | The rate limit period (eg. 1m, 12h, 1d).         |
| `X-Rate-Limit-Remaining` | Number of request remaining.                     |
| `X-Rate-Limit-Reset`     | UTC date time (ISO 8601) when the limits resets. |

A client can parse the `X-Rate-Limit-Reset` like this:

```
DateTime resetDate = DateTime.ParseExact(resetHeader, "o", 
    DateTimeFormatInfo.InvariantInfo);
```

#### Best Practices <a href="best-practices" id="best-practices"></a>

* When the limit has been reached, stop making API calls. Continuing to make calls will continue to increase your call count, which will increase the time before calls will be successful again.
* Spread out queries evenly to avoid traffic spikes.
* Use filters to limit the data response size and avoid calls that request overlapping data.
* Check the `X-App-Usage` HTTP header to see how close your app is to its limit and when you can resume making calls when the limit has been reached.
