| Gas and Gas costs | Blockchains have one significant limitation with regards to the amount of data that can be stored in a block and consequently the amount of data that can be synchronized between the nodes. To throttle this amount, most blockchains simply charge for the processing of information. In the Ethereum network, this charge is referred to as gas cost. With “gas” being an arbitrary number, which serves as quantification for the sum of processing difficulty and amount of data. On the Ethereum blockchain, this gas cost must be paid with the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain, Ether (ETH). If the user does not have enough Ether, then the transaction is not processed. There is no mechanism to “pay later”. |
