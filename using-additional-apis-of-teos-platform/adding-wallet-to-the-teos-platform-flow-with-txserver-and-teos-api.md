# Adding wallet to the TEOS Platform flow with TxServer and TEOS API

To add a signable wallet to the TeosAPI following calls, depicted in the Diagram 1. should be performed:

* Device token should be acquired for the next calls to TeosApi and TxServer. For the details refer to the [device authorization flow](device-authorization-flow-with-txserver-and-teos-authentication-service.md)
* TeosApi function [InitWalletRegistration](https://teosapi.coreledger.net/swagger/index.html) is called, to generate WalletRegistrationClaim
* Using the data from the claim, received in previous step, the app calls TXServer function [SendAddressToProvider](https://txapi.coreledger.net/swagger/index.html#/Device/post_api_Device_SendAddressToProvider), to link the wallet with the transactions provider (more about provider [here](using-txserver-api/#provider))
