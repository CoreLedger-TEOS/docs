# 👋 Welcome!

{% hint style="info" %}
We've delivered cool changes with a brand new v0.17. Check [what's new](wlp-versions-and-changelog/version-0.17.md)!
{% endhint %}

**White Label Portal (WLP)** is a customizable web application, which represents the bridge between fiat money or physical goods and digital assets within TEOS platform.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**TEOS platform** is CoreLedger's main product, it allows companies to integrate blockchain technology into their business processes. [Learn more](https://coreledger.net/teos/) about it and [contact us](https://coreledger.net/contact/)
{% endhint %}

While working with WLP, since it is the part of TEOS platform, you may also need to check the docs of other TEOS platform components:

* [White Label Management Tool](https://app.gitbook.com/o/ZaeNizhnU47lCcTSk7wB/s/tUL13xBnNCyueYnmUZV7/) (WLM) - due to strong dependencies of the WLP to WLM, its highly recommended to check WLM docs upfront and start by using WLM and TX.Mobile
* [White Label Mobile App (WLA)](https://app.gitbook.com/o/ZaeNizhnU47lCcTSk7wB/s/7Xg7iannH70Bvo1bfqMb/)
* [TEOS API](https://app.gitbook.com/o/ZaeNizhnU47lCcTSk7wB/s/-McAKJLTTEmlfBIFJ-85/)

Please be aware, that figures, assets and names used in the docs might be different from your customized application.&#x20;
