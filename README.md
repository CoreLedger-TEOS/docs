# Welcome!

{% hint style="info" %}
We've delivered a new [Estrella](wlm-versions-and-changelog/estrella.md) release on the 9th of January. Check out what's new!
{% endhint %}

These pages introduce configuration options of the White Label Management Tool (WLM) and its core functionality. WLM is a customizable webapp for managing blockchain data like digital assets, supplies, controllers and configuring the tenant for your business case needs. Also this documentation describes how to use TX.Mobile to work with WLM.

Most of the business cases which we encountered so far assume that tenant admins use WLM so both [admin-user-guide](admin-user-guide/ "mention") and [user-guide](user-guide/ "mention") are valid for tenant admins.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please be aware, that figures, assets and names used in the documentation might be different from your customized WLM
{% endhint %}
