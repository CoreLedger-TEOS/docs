White Label Portal (WLP) is a customizable web application, which represents the bridge between fiat money or physical goods and digital assets within TEOS.

While working with WLP, since it is the part of TEOS platform, you may also need to check the docs of other TEOS products:

* [White Label Management Tool](https://app.gitbook.com/o/ZaeNizhnU47lCcTSk7wB/s/tUL13xBnNCyueYnmUZV7/) (WLM) - due to strong dependencies of the WLP to WLM, its highly recommended to check WLM docs upfront and start by using WLM and TX.Mobile
* [White Label Mobile App (WLA)](https://app.gitbook.com/o/ZaeNizhnU47lCcTSk7wB/s/7Xg7iannH70Bvo1bfqMb/)
* [TEOS API](https://app.gitbook.com/o/ZaeNizhnU47lCcTSk7wB/s/-McAKJLTTEmlfBIFJ-85/)

Please be aware, that figures, assets and names used in the docs might be different from your customized application.&#x20;
