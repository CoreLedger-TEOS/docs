## v0.8 <a href="#v2_2_new_features" id="v2_2_new_features"></a>

#### New Features:

*   Now most of the TEOS API functionality is available with TEOS API key. Swagger clearly states which endpoints can't be called using TEOS API key.&#x20;

    The list of the endpoints which still can be called only with user token are:

    * GET /odata/v0.8/Assets/My
    * GET /odata/v0.8/Balances/My
    * GET /odata/v0.8/Transactions/My
    * GET /odata/v0.8/Wallets/My
    * DELETE /odata/v0.8/Users({key})
    * POST /odata/v0.8/Wallets/InitWalletRegistration
* In order to introduce the support of api key for [creating and signing transactions](../overview/dealing-with-blockchain-transactions/transaction-creation-and-submission/) following changes were done:
  * when transaction is posted, the SigningParameters are returned
  * an endpoint to get SigningParamters is introduced: \
    GET /odata/v0.8/Transactions({key})/GetSigningParameters
  * check for the address ownership is removed for all endpoints except for the ones mentioned in the list of calling with user token
  * an endpoint to submit a signed transaction: \
    POST /odata/v0.8/Transactions/{key}/Submit
* New endpoint is added to add the wallet to TEOS to have the possibility to use it afterwards\
  POST /odata/v0.8/Wallets
* New endpoint is added to retrieve transactions with TEOS API key. Don't forget to use odata technology to filter the list according to your business case needs \
  GET /odata/v0.8/Transactions
* We created methods which have the logic for filtering corresponding data by user (they end with .../My), thus they can be used with user token only
  * GET /odata/v0.8/Assets/My
  * GET /odata/v0.8/Balances/My
  * GET /odata/v0.8/Transactions/My
  * GET /odata/v0.8/Wallets/My

#### Changes:

* :point\_right:Signing  flow with user token is changed according to the description in [#flow-with-user-token](../overview/dealing-with-blockchain-transactions/transaction-creation-and-submission/#flow-with-user-token "mention")
* :point\_right:POST /odata/v0.8/Assets: the posted transaction is returned instead of asset
* Asset object was changed:
  * section "Translations" was added. Now asset data can be retrieved with translations. Don't forget to use odata technology to filter the list of languages when retrieving asset data according to your business case&#x20;
  * new parameter "createdInTeosOn" was introduced - date of asset creation in TEOS, defined when asset is created in TEOS and never changes afterwards
  * :point\_right:parameter "createdOn" was changed to "createdInBlockchainOn - date of asset creation in blockchain (block date), at first is NULL, defined when asset is created in blockchain and never changes afterwards
  * :point\_right:parameter "updatedOn" was changed to "amendedInBlockchainOn" - date of asset amendment writing to blockchain, at first is NULL, only if amendment is added and written to blockchain this property is filled
* &#x20;:point\_right:Transaction model is changed
  * The type of the property TypeId is changed from int to enum TransactionType
  * Following properties are removed:

```
Guid? EntityId { get; set; }
string EntityCLId { get; set; }
AssetId? RelatedCLAssetId { get; set; }
int? RelatedCLLedgerId { get; set; }
string RelatedCLControllerAddressId { get; set; }
Guid? RelatedTxId { get; set; }
bool IsFake { get; set; }
bool IsHiddenNotifications { get; set; }
string Keywords { get; set; }
string MessageTemplate { get; set; }
string GasPrice { get; set; }
string GasUsed { get; set; }
```

* The transaction metadata has now property UniqueAssetId when it is created in TEOS API
* :point\_right:GET /odata/v0.8/Wallets \
  GET /odata/v0.8/Wallets/My\
  these endpoints use forced pagination, each page has a maximum size of 50 lines
* GET /odata/v0.8/Balances/GetAssetsBalances(addresses={addresses},uniqueAssetIds={uniqueAssetIds}) was added to get array of addresses and uniqueAssetIds as request parameters
* :point\_right:GET Balances was renamed to GET Balances/My

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Breaking changes:**

* Signing  flow with user token is changed according to the description in [#flow-with-user-token](../overview/dealing-with-blockchain-transactions/transaction-creation-and-submission/#flow-with-user-token "mention")
* POST /odata/v0.8/Assets: the posted transaction is returned instead of Asset
* Asset model was changed: parameter "createdOn" was changed to "createdInBlockchainOn", parameter "updatedOn" was changed to "amendedInBlockchainOn" (check their description above)
* Transaction model was changed (check the changes above)
* GET /odata/v0.8/Wallets use forced pagination, each page has a maximum size of 50 lines, this is a change relevant for all versions
* GET Balances was renamed to GET Balances/My
{% endhint %}

#### Fixed bugs:

* We eliminated the performance problem with assets retrieval. Now GET /odata/v0.8/Assets and GET /odata/v0.8/Assets/My work faster

#### New Features:

* Attribute entities and their endpoints are introduced:
  * Country
  * Currency

#### Changes:

* Routing keys of all events produced by TEOS API have prefix tenant-id which is taken from [claims of authentication token](../using-the-teos-api/authentication.md#token-scopes-and-claims)

{% hint style="warning" %}
