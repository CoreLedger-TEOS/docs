TEOS API Json Framework was changed from legacy Newtonsoft .Net JSON to Microsoft System.Text.Json. This impacts the way, how incoming and outgoing parameters are serialized.

More details about migration to new serializer can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/serialization/system-text-json-migrate-from-newtonsoft-how-to?pivots=dotnet-5-0).
