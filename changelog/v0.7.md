## New Features:

* Attribute entities and their endpoints are introduced:
  * Country
  * Currency
  * Unit
  * Language
  * Asset Class
  * Asset Detail Class
  * Search Property
* Asset of type 'currency' (cash and cash equivalent) can be created with currencyCode parameter instead of unitOfMeasureCode. Check the [rules of CurrencyCode definition](../using-the-teos-api/concepts/asset.md#general-properties)
* Invoice state changes events are delivered. More details [here](../overview/teos-events.md#invoicestatechanged)

## Changes:
