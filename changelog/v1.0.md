{% hint style="warning" %}
**Breaking changes:**

* **Asset creation and update flow now includes contractSet-prefixed tenant names.**\
  Clients must ensure tenant names used in requests are correctly prefixed with the corresponding contract set to avoid request failures.
* **Controller schema and metadata format have been updated.**\
  This affects operations related to controller creation, editing, and deletion. In particular, the `UniqueAssetId` field is now required when adding or deleting an asset controller. API consumers must update their payloads accordingly to match the new structure.
{% endhint %}

## Fixed bugs:

* Fixed asset metadata naming and missing transaction ID in responses.
* Fixed Swagger documentation examples
