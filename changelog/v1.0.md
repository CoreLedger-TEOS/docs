    🔗 `GET /odata/v1.0/Supplies/list/{category}/{ethereumAddress}/{pageSize}/{pageNumber}`
  * Retrieve supply count by wallet address:\
    🔗 `GET /odata/v1.0/Supplies/count/{ethereumAddress}`
  * Create a new supply:\
    🔗 `POST /odata/v1.0/Supplies`
  * Extend supply expiration date:\

  * Change exchange rate:\

    🔗 `DELETE /odata/v1.0/Supplies({key})`
* **Retrieve total amount of an asset**\
  It is now possible to retrieve the total amount of a specific asset.\

* **Support for chainId in transaction signing**\
  Transaction signing now includes the chain identifier to enhance security.\
  🔗 `POST /odata/v1.0/Transactions/Sign`
* **API availability and access key validation endpoint**\
  Added an endpoint to check the availability of a specific TEOS API version and validate the access key.\

* **Support for querying assets using OData filters**\

## Changes:

* Default pagination with a global page limit is now applied across all returned data collections to improve performance and usability.
* Improved transaction signing and validation by switching to a delegated grant validator.
* Better error handling and more descriptive error codes returned for failed transactions and OData filters.
* Improved logging: bad requests are now logged more effectively for debugging.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Breaking changes:**

* **Asset creation and update flow now includes contractSet-prefixed tenant names.**\
  Clients must ensure tenant names used in requests are correctly prefixed with the corresponding contract set to avoid request failures.
* **Controller schema and metadata format have been updated.**\
  This affects operations related to controller creation, editing, and deletion. In particular, the `UniqueAssetId` field is now required when adding or deleting an asset controller. API consumers must update their payloads accordingly to match the new structure.
{% endhint %}

## Fixed bugs:

* Fixed asset metadata naming and missing transaction ID in responses.
* Fixed Swagger documentation examples.
