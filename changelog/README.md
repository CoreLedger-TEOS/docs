# Changelog

These changelogs document versioned and out-of-cycle changes to the TEOS API.

#### Versioned Changes

Versioned changes are changes introduced with the release of a new API [version](versions/). Versioned changes typically apply to the newest version immediately and often will apply to other versions at a future date. The changelog accompanying each release indicates which changes apply to the current release and which changes apply to other versions.

#### Out-Of-Cycle Changes

Out-of-cycle changes are changes introduced outside of our normal, versioned release schedule and typically do not apply to a specific version. Instead, out-of-cycle changes usually apply to all API versions immediately. Because of this, out-of-cycle changes are introduced infrequently.
