description: Steps to get started with TEOS API, info to check while expecting the tenant

# ðŸ“ˆ Get started

We're working on introducing fully automated flow for setting up a new tenant, which will need a lot of configuration questions to be answered right at the start. Until it's in place, we're happy to offer you the care and support of one of our CoreLedger managers who help customers to find right answers.

In order to start building your apps with TEOS API you need a few steps to be taken:

1. Make sure you have a contract signed with CoreLedger and filled out the customer's questionnaire to provide set of starting configurations. If you don't have a signed contract yet, please, [use this form](https://coreledger.net/contact/) to request a meeting with our manager to onboard you. While being onboarded, you will be asked several questions to define the configuration you need, you can think about them already:\
   \- blockchain network against which your solution is going to work (SparkNet private blockchain, SparkNet shared blockchain, Ethereum Mainnet) and type of assets you need (FT, NFT)\
   \- which environments you need right away (dev\&testing and/or productive)\
   \- set of TEOS platform components which you will need except for TEOS API (check what TEOS platform offers on [CoreLedger website](https://coreledger.net/))\
   \- name of the tenant
2. After you provided all necessary info to setup your first tenant, we will create it for you. Also we will deliver you the API key via trustworthy communication channel if it is requested for your setup.&#x20;
3. As soon as you have your tenant ready, you can start developing your application by trying out TEOS API functionality using [Postman examples.](https://github.com/CoreLedger-TEOS/API) We recommend to start with creating your first transaction, check the flow in [transaction-creation-and-submission.md](overview/transaction-creation-and-submission.md "mention")

While you're waiting for your tenant to be prepared, we invite you to start exploring TEOS API with following topics:
