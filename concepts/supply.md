# Supply

TEOS users can create supplies in order to trade their assets. **Supply is an offer** created by a user **to get specific amount of sparks of desired asset in exchange to specific amount of sparks of offered asset**.

Supplies are consumed by other TEOS users when they execute trades, or execute [warps](warp.md), where supplies existing on blockchain take part.
