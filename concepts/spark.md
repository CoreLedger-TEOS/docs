# Spark

Each asset, if it's countable, has its own unit of measure which is defined based on the nature of the asset, for example, steel is measure in kilograms or tons and man-hours in days or hours. **Spark is the smallest indivisible item of a digital asset** which can stand for minute, hour, gram, milligram or any other smallest indivisible part of the unit of measure that makes sense for specific asset of TEOS user.&#x20;

TEOS user can define how many sparks he needs for 1 unit of measure with the help of Spark factor.

Asset described [here](asset.md) has liter as a unit of measure and 1000000 as spark factor which means that its indivisible part in a material world is a milliliter. TEOS API user which creates such asset doesn't operate with the units smaller than a 0,000001 of a liter.

### Spark operations

TEOS user can **create** and **destroy sparks** to manage the available amount of his digital asset.&#x20;

TEOS user can **transfer sparks** of his assets from wallet where he keeps them to another wallets (owned by him or other users).

TEOS user can get sparks of assets and TEOS user's sparks of assets can be consumed as a part of **warp execution** process. [Learn more](warp.md)
