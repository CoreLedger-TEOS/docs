# How your users interact with WLA

WLA provides various functionalities to the users, which are described in this section.

For testing purposes, itâ€™s recommended to transfer some Sparks to the WLA wallet using the WLM and TX.Mobile (check [login-and-wallet-creation.md](../admin-user-guide/login-and-wallet-creation.md "mention"))

All users of the WLA-based apps as part of [Active Sandbox](https://coreledger.net/active-sandbox/) should download the app from Testflight or Appcenter, register and create wallet taking the same steps as admins (described in [login-and-wallet-creation.md](../admin-user-guide/login-and-wallet-creation.md "mention"))
