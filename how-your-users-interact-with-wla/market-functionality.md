# Market functionality

## Buy and sell

A precondition to sell and buy Sparks, is that the corresponding supplies are created in TEOS (via WLA or WLM).

In the “Market” screen you can simply click Search for supplies and define whether you want to Sell or Receive assets. You define assets which you want to trade and, additionally, enter either an amount you want to sell, or an amount you want to receive and click on search for supplies.

All existing supplies will be listed. You then can select one of the existing supplies and make the trade (see Figure 5).

## Create supply

If you didn't find desired supply in the result of [#buy-and-sell](market-functionality.md#buy-and-sell "mention") you can create your own supply. You are selling an asset and getting another asset in return.\
Go to My supplies and follow the steps described above [#buy-and-sell](market-functionality.md#buy-and-sell "mention"), but make sure you enter an amount in both fields, sell and receive. Then you have the option to create a supply (see Figure 6). As the supply is created, other users can find  and consume it.

A list of own supplies can be viewed in the My supplies list of the “Market” screen.
