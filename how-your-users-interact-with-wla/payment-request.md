# Payment request

If you click on the menu, the WLA offers the opportunity to create a “Payment request”.

Here you can select an asset and enter an amount to request. A QR code will be created (see figure below).

Another user then can scan this QR code with his WLA (click on QR in the bottom right) . If the user accepts the payment request, a blockchain transaction will be triggered and the requested Sparks will be sent to the user who created the payment request.
