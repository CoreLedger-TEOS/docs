Following details are available:

* public address\
  User can also use QR code with the public address to show to other WLA users&#x20;
* Ether balance\
  WLA is based on Ethereum blockchain, so each signing of a transaction costs some ETH. Most of WLAs are running against private blockchain, so ETH is distributed automatically. A very low balance of ETH plus the high costs of a specific transaction can block transaction signing

User can click the wallet and open wallet details where Sign data is available. User can sign any text and send this signature in hex or base64 format to prove the ownership of his wallet. This functionality is added as a separate [optional module for WLA-based apps](../admin-user-guide/wla-modules.md).
