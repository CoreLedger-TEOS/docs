# Payment request & Invoices

If you click on the menu, you can see Payment request menu item where you can select Create request tab for creating a payment request or an invoice.

{% hint style="info" %}
Difference between payment request and invoice:

Invoice record is created and saved in TEOS. Invoice can expire when expiry date comes.

Payment request is a QR code only, no record in TEOS is created when payment request is generated.
{% endhint %}

## Payment request generation

You can select an asset and enter an amount to request. A QR code with payment request will be created (see figure below). You can make it bigger and share QR data via any available messenger.

## Paying Payment request and Invoice

Another user can scan this QR code with his WLA (click on QR in the bottom right corner). If the user accepts the payment request or decides to pay the invoice, a blockchain transaction will be triggered and the requested sparks will be sent to the user who created the payment request or to the target address defined in the invoice.

If the app is setup in the way that feature for warp transfer is switched on and if user doesn't have required asset in the invoice, when user scans invoice or payment request QR code, he or she will be offered to search for other payment options using our warp transfer technology.
