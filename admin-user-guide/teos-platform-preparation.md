# TEOS Platform preparation

As an administrator, you can specify, which Terms\&Conditions (T\&C) and Data Policy documents will be displayed to your users during registration flow. In order to do that, you need to provide T\&C and Data Policy documents in HTML format to your CoreLedger manager.

Also, after the documents have been provided, "Support" section in WLM will now contain the corresponding links to T\&C and Data Policy documents. When the link is clicked, the user will be redirected to the Authentication Server page with the provided documents.
