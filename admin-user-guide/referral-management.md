# Referral management

As an administrator you can generate and send referral codes to potential users. This helps you to ensure, that only users you invited can sign up to your tenant or e.g. to track the effectiveness of a campaign where you hand out referrals.&#x20;

Click on “Administrate” and select “Referrals”. The page shows you an overview to manage the referrals. On top of the page, you can select different views by clicking on “Unused”, “Sent”, “Registered” or “Expired”. All unused referrals can be deleted, then they cannot be found in any of the lists. You **can't** undo this action.

All unused expired referrals can be found in "Expired" view.

### Generate referrals

If you want to generate referrals, you can click on the button “Generate referral” on the top right of the page .

### Invite users with referrals

After you generated new referrals, you can click the three dots at the right side to send an email with the code to potential user. After email has been sent, the referral moves to "Sent" view.

The invited user can enter the referral code during the sign-up process. After a user signed up with a referral code, you can see a green “R” symbol in the user management section. The used up referral moves to "Used" view of Referrals.
