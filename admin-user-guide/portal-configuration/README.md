# Portal configuration

Follow the steps below to adjust portal to your needs:

Step 1. Go to Configuration management page and allow other users collaborate on WLP as admins [admin-users-management.md](admin-users-management.md "mention")

Step 2. Adjust general settings of tenant configuration such as app name, languages and currency [tenant-configuration.md](tenant-configuration.md "mention")

Step 3. Adjust the look and feel of the portal to make it recognizable by your end-users [branding-management.md](branding-management.md "mention")

Step 4. Configure features which you want your portal to have (don't forget to provide accounts for third-party services!) [features-configuration](features-configuration/ "mention")

Step 5. Switch features on for your end-users. Let the portal running by TEOS on blockchain work for your case! [features-configuration](features-configuration/ "mention")

In subpages you can find the description of how your portal can be configured. WLP configurations can be adjusted by several means (depending on the setting you want to configure):\
1\. "Configuration management" section where you can find nice UI for managing admin users, WLA name and switching on/off portal features\
2\. "Advanced config management" section with json editor. Most of the settings are configured there. Every change in the editor is reflected in the WLP immediately after refreshing the page. In some cases, the browser cache must be cleared before the changes are present. We're working on moving all configurations to "Configuration management" section\
3\. Blob storage created specifically for your tenant and containing files with asset pictures, logo, etc and colors file which is used for colors management
