# WLA modules

Starting from v0.19 WLA code base is divided into several modules. Now you can use only those modules which are necessary for your business case. The list of available modules:

* tech modules which are mandatory to use: core, authorization, api requests
* optional business modules:
  * QR code scanner
  * assets overview
  * payment requests and invoices
  * decentralized market
  * signing generic texts

Contact your CoreLedger manager if you need WLA code base to build your own app. Access to each module repository and WLA as app template built with this code base are provided according to your agreement with CL.
