# Branding management

If you want to customize your WLM's appearance, you can click on “Administrate” and choose “Appearance”. If you are ok with using the current WLM look and feel, you can skip the section, though we highly recommend to set logo at least.

## Colors

The page opens with the color settings and immediately provides a preview of the your WLM look and feel.

You can select the colors for different user interface elements which will present your branding vision. Or instead you can click on "Image based" and upload a picture of your logo, for example. WLM will select the colors based on picture's colors, you will be able to adjust them afterwards.

You can save the set of colors as the theme and create another one to compare them.

## Logo and favicon

Additionally, you can select “Logo” to change the logo which is shown in the top left corner of your tenant.

In this section you can also upload "Favicon" for the WLM - small icon displayed in the tab of the browser.

## Icons

On the top of the page you can choose “Icons” to edit the icons, used to display transaction types in the dashboard and functionality in the navigation menu bar. We recommend not to change them unless you have high-quality icons designed specifically for WLM.
