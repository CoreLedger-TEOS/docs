# Admin user guide

For each tenant and WLM specifically we assign administrator role to the user you've sent to us. This admin will be able to invite more users and assign administrator role to them.\
Default admin role incorporates a variety of functionalities, which are described in this section.&#x20;

Apart from them, admin may need to check how tenant collection of definition items can be managed which is described in [#definition-items-management](../user-guide/additional-settings-management.md#definition-items-management "mention") or how tenant filter can be used [#filters-management](../user-guide/additional-settings-management.md#filters-management "mention")

We recommend admins to start with following steps:

1. Complete the steps for setting up your account and wallet described in [where-to-start](../where-to-start/ "mention")&#x20;
2. Adjust WLM to your needs by configuring branding settings and templates [wlm-configuration](wlm-configuration/ "mention")
3. Invite other users with the help of referrals [#invite-users-with-referrals](referral-management.md#invite-users-with-referrals "mention") and promote them to admins [#assign-role](user-management.md#assign-role "mention") or new roles you've created [role-management.md](role-management.md "mention")
4. Check how WLM admins can interact with portal when it is already setup in other pages of this section
5. Check which non-administrative functionality is available in WLM [user-guide](../user-guide/ "mention")
