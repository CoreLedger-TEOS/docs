# Admin user guide

## Where to start?

We recommend to start with following steps:

1.  Create new users or login with existing one to setup WLP\
    Open the URL to your WLP instance which was provided to you. You should see the welcome / login page, here you need to register a new account, or you can login with an already existing one.

    :point\_right: Itâ€™s recommended, to use the login from the already created WLM account, which you also use in TX.Mobile and WLA.&#x20;
2. Adjust portal to your needs [portal-configuration](portal-configuration/ "mention")
3. Check how admins can interact with portal when it is already setup  [admin-functionality.md](admin-functionality.md "mention")
4. Check how your end users can interact with your portal [how-your-users-interact-with-the-portal.md](../how-your-users-interact-with-the-portal.md "mention")
