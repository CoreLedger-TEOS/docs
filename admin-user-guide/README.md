# Admin user guide

## Where to start?

### If WLA is provided to you as part of Active Sandbox

If you're only starting to setup WLA, we recommend to follow these steps:

1. Download WLA to your device using the link to Appcenter
2.  Create new user or login with existing one to WLA [login-and-wallet-creation.md](login-and-wallet-creation.md "mention")\
    Open WLA. You should see the welcome / login page, here you need to register a new account, or you can login with an already existing one. After login you will be able to check functionality and to check how your configuration is applied

    :point\_right: Itâ€™s recommended, to use the login from the already created WLM account, which you also use in TX.Mobile and WLP.&#x20;
3. Adjust WLA to your business needs [app-configuration](app-configuration/ "mention")
4. Check how your end users can interact with the app [how-your-users-interact-with-wla](../how-your-users-interact-with-wla/ "mention")

### If you're going to build your own mobile application based on WLA code base

1. First check our modular based concept described here [wla-modules.md](wla-modules.md "mention")
2. Make sure that you have access to CL github with necessary modules and WLA code base as a template. If you don't have it, contact your CL manager
3. Follow the steps described in readme files of corresponding modules
4. We highly recommend to check the steps necessary for WLA configuration, they can help you to understand which part of WLA code base to use
