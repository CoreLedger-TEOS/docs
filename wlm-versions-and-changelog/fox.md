# Fox

### Changes:

*   **Default pagination implemented for all data collections to improve performance and usability**

    To enhance system performance and user experience, all responses returning data collections are now paginated by default. This means data is delivered in manageable portions with clear indicators when more results are available. These changes ensure faster loading times and smoother navigation when working with large datasets.
*   **Support for adding external controllers in WLM**

    Users can now add external controllers that already exist on the blockchain but were not created through the TEOS Platform directly to their tenant’s controller list. This improvement enhances flexibility and integration capabilities, allowing unified management of both TEOS-created and external controllers in a single place.
*   **Improved password input experience on sign-up and password change**

    Users can now edit their initially entered password if it doesn’t meet requirements, without losing it completely. This makes correcting password mistakes easier and speeds up the registration and password update process.
*   **Expanded supply data access by wallet address**

    Users can now fetch supplies and their counts not only by category but also filtered by wallet address, enabling more precise and personalized data retrieval.
*   **Improved system performance and security**

    The platform components have been enhanced to ensure better performance, increased stability, and stronger security measures. These improvements offer users a faster, more reliable, and more secure experience.
* **Enhanced system monitoring for improved reliability**\
  A new health check has been implemented to continuously monitor data synchronization between TMS and Azure, ensuring smoother operation and faster detection of potential issues.

### Fixes:

*   **Fixed wallet display limitation in Wallet Management**

    Users with a large number of wallets (over 1 000) can now view all their wallets in the Wallet Management section without restrictions, ensuring full visibility and easier management.
*   **Fixed incorrect date display in asset definitions after activation**

    The issue that caused incorrect date values to appear in definition items after asset activation has been resolved.
*   **Fixed password input issue on authentication screen**

    Users can now click and interact with the entire password input field without any restrictions, ensuring a smoother and more intuitive login experience.
*   **Improved user registration approval speed in WLM**

    The delay between admin approval and user activation in the system has been significantly reduced. Now, once an admin confirms a new user, the approval status updates almost instantly, ensuring faster access and a smoother onboarding experience.
