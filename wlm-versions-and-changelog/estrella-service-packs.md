# Estrella Service Packs

## Estrella Service Pack 3 (delivered on April, 30)

### Changes:

* User can now reject a transaction with a single device, even if user's address has been added to several devices. In order to reject a transaction with a single device, a user must be the owner of the private key for the respective wallet. When transaction is rejected in one device, it's rejected in all devices of the user correspondingly.&#x20;
* Time zone settings will be taken from user's local device, which will make the use of White Label Management Tool even more convenient. There is no need to set the time zone separately in Profile settings now.

### Fixes:

* Resend confirmation email in WLA is now branded, just like other customer-related emails.

## Estrella Service Pack 2 (delivered on March, 14)

### Changes:

* When user enters incorrect password 5 times, a user is warned via email "Account Security Alert: Your Account is Temporarily Locked". The user has an ability to change password by using "Change password" link from the email. The email can only be sent in English for now.
* In one of the previous releases we have made the update, that customized Terms\&Conditions and Data Policy are accepted during registration flow. Therefore we have removed  the acceptance of Terms\&Conditions, when registering profile in WLM. Check [how you can set up the Terms\&Conditions and Data Policy and how the flow works.](../admin-user-guide/teos-platform-preparation.md)&#x20;
* Users can still review T\&C and Data Policy documents, if they navigate to the "Support" section and click the corresponding link. When the link is clicked, the users will be redirected to the corresponding page with provided documents.

## Estrella Service Pack 1 (delivered on January, 25)

### Changes:

* We've improved event deliverability and increased event reliability.
* We've added password confirmation field during account creation, so that it will be easier for you and your users to remember the created password.
* The design for login/sign up screens has been updated and refurbished a bit to be more user-friendly.
* When providing translation files for Terms\&Conditions and Data Policy documents, you will not need to provide separate file for document title: everything can be now provided within one document.
