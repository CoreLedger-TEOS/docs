# Estrella Service Packs

## Estrella Service Pack 1 (coming soon)

### Changes:

* We've improved event deliverability and increased event reliability.
* We've added password confirmation field during account creation, so that it will be easier for you and your users to remember the created password.
* The design for login/sign up screens has been updated and refurbished a bit to be more user-friendly.
* When providing translation files for Terms\&Conditions and Data Policy documents, you will not need to provide separate file for document title: everything can be now provided within one document.
