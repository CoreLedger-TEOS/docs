# Batman

We fixed some bugs to make our solution more user-friendly and stable.

We fixed the problem with displaying the whole list of wallets in the unit allocation section.&#x20;

We introduced notification for the case when you have problems with connection which limits WLM functionality.&#x20;

Also starting from this version users can delete their TEOS accounts with all associated data automatically. Feel free to contact us to provide any feedback or report errors.
