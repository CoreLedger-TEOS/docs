# Fox Service Packs

## Fox Service Pack 1 (coming soon)

### Changes:

*   **Enhanced error visibility and faster support resolution**

    The platform now provides improved end-to-end request traceability across all core components. When an error occurs, users will see a unique reference identifier together with the error message. This identifier can be shared with the support team to quickly locate the exact request flow that caused the issue.

    This improvement enables faster and more accurate incident investigation, reduces resolution time, and simplifies communication with support. It also strengthens operational transparency and ensures a more predictable experience when running complex or high-volume workflows.
*   **Improved control over SDK lifecycle in WLM**

    The platform manages SDK dependencies more consistently across their full lifecycle, ensuring components are initialized and stopped in a controlled and predictable manner. This improves overall system stability, supports smoother deployments and updates, and ensures more reliable operation of WLM.
*   **Optimized blockchain resource usage and system stability**

    The platform manages SDK dependencies more consistently across their full lifecycle, ensuring components are initialized and stopped in a controlled and predictable manner. This improves overall system stability, supports smoother deployments and updates, and ensures more reliable operation of WLM.

### Fixes:

*   **Fixed transaction field naming in WLM**

    The Transaction Id label has been updated to Transaction Hash in WLM to align with standard blockchain terminology and improve clarity when working with transaction data.
*   **Fixed missing transaction notifications in TxMobile**

    An issue where users did not receive notifications when a new transaction was created has been resolved. Notifications are now delivered correctly, ensuring users are promptly informed about newly created transactions.
*   **Fixed asset page refresh after amendment confirmation**

    The Asset page refreshes automatically after an amendment transaction is confirmed. The updated asset state is displayed correctly once the transaction is completed.
