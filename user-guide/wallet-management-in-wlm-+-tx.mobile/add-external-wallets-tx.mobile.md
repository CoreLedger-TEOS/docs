# Add external wallets (TX.Mobile)

In case you have some wallets which were created with the help of 3rd party services, you still can add them to TX.Mobile to use in TEOS.

To add the wallets, go to “Wallets”, click on the symbol “+” and select "Add existing wallet". You will need to add public address and private keys for each wallet you want to restore by scanning QR codes with this data or by adding them manually.
