# Profile settings

To manage your profile settings, you should go to "Profile".&#x20;

There you can manage your WLM profile data by editing it directly on the page (birth date, avatar, time zone, language, default units of measure). Also you can check data from your TEOS account data (name, last name, email), if you need to edit it, you can do it by clicking "Edit my info".

Check more about units in [#units-of-measure](create-asset.md#units-of-measure "mention")
