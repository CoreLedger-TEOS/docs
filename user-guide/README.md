# User guide

After you completed the registration process according to [where-to-start](../where-to-start/ "mention"), you should have WLM account as well as the TX.Mobile app with a wallet connected to the web app.

You can now start using the platform to e.g. sell, buy and trade assets. Additionally, you can create an asset and thus connect the physical to the digital world.

We highly recommend to pay your attention to [sign-and-check-executed-transactions.md](sign-and-check-executed-transactions.md "mention") if it's your first blockchain based application.

If your case is creating and managing custom tokens then we recommend to follow these steps:

1. Create asset [create-asset.md](create-asset.md "mention")
2. Create units [create-units.md](manage-asset-asset-details-asset-operations/create-units.md "mention")
3. Create supply to sell your asset [#create-supply](supply-management.md#create-supply "mention") or simply transfer units [transfer-units.md](manage-asset-asset-details-asset-operations/transfer-units.md "mention") if needed
4. Configure WLA [White Label Mobile App](http://localhost:5000/o/ZaeNizhnU47lCcTSk7wB/s/7Xg7iannH70Bvo1bfqMb/ "mention") and/or WLP [White Label Portal](http://localhost:5000/o/ZaeNizhnU47lCcTSk7wB/s/iTYqY7GQFlQO0s8Vbk2r/ "mention") to use this asset
