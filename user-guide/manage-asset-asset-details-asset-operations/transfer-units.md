# Transfer units

You can transfer a specific amount of owned assets to another Ethereum address (it can be owned by you or any other user - it doesn't matter).

{% hint style="info" %}
Please, note that WLM always uses your Current wallet for creating transaction. Signature will be expected from this wallet. Current wallet is displayed right under your account name in the sidebar menu.
{% endhint %}

If you want to transfer units, you first choose one of your assets you want to transfer and then click on “Transfer Units”.

You can click on the “To” field and the system opens your wallet list. If you want to send the asset to someone else, whom address you don’t have stored in your wallet list, you can just paste the Ethereum address (public address) into the “To” field, fill out the amount to transfer and confirm with “Transfer”.

You can provide the amount in natural units or in sparks. See more about the difference [#units-of-measure](../create-asset.md#units-of-measure "mention")

The transaction will be pushed to the TX.Mobile app for signature. Sign the transaction [sign-and-check-executed-transactions.md](../sign-and-check-executed-transactions.md "mention")
