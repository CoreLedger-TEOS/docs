# Link assets

Some business cases need to link several assets. For this purpose TEOS has assets linking functionality. &#x20;

To link one asset to another ones, go to "Assets", select the asset and go to tab "Links" of asset details. Click "Link asset" and select the assets which should be linked to the current one.

Under the tab "Links" you can check all assets which are linked to the current one. There you can also remove the existing links.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please, note that WLM always uses your Current wallet for creating transaction. Signature for creating links and removing links will be expected from this wallet. Current wallet is displayed right under your account name in the sidebar menu.
{% endhint %}

After triggering linking/removing links, the transaction will be pushed to the TX.Mobile app for signature. Sign the transaction [sign-and-check-executed-transactions.md](../sign-and-check-executed-transactions.md "mention")
