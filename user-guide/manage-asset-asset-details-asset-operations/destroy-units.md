# Destroy units

You can only destroy units of the asset, if you are the Issuer of the asset and only owned units. Otherwise, the function “Destroy Units” will not be available.

To do it, choose your asset and click on “Destroy Units”.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please, note that WLM always uses your Current wallet for creating transaction. Signature will be expected from this wallet. Current wallet is displayed right under your account name in the sidebar menu.
{% endhint %}

You can provide the amount in natural units or in sparks. See more about the difference [#units-of-measure](../create-asset.md#units-of-measure "mention")

By clicking on “Destroy” the transaction is being pushed to the TX.Mobile app. Sign the transaction [sign-and-check-executed-transactions.md](../sign-and-check-executed-transactions.md "mention")

After its successful processing the number of available units on your current address will decrease by the amount you put in the “Destroy” field.
