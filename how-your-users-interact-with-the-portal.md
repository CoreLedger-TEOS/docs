# How your users interact with the portal

## KYC checks

If you enable KYC functionality, availability and visibility of functionality for user is defined by his current KYC tier. Functionality which is not available will be closed by "Get KYC tier N". Users will be forced to go through KYC checks to get required KYC tier.

After clicking "Get tier N" user is redirected to KYC provider's page, verification process takes place on the provider's page.

After user passes all necessary checks he is redirected back to the portal. After he gets an admin's approval of KYC tier (process described in [#kyc-management](admin-user-guide/admin-functionality.md#kyc-management "mention")), all functionality configured for this tier will be available for him.

## Shop

Under the section “Shop” all assets configured in the “Config Management” section are listed.

Clicking on “More details” opens the URL set in the config file. Clicking on “Add to cart” allows to add some quantities of this asset to user's shopping cart as shown below.

Click on “Checkout” brings user to the collection method selection screen.&#x20;

As next step user can select how he wants to receive the purchased items. The list of collection methods [can be configured](admin-user-guide/portal-configuration/features-configuration/purchase-assets-and-featured-asset.md#collection-methods-configuration) in the “Advanced Configuration Management” editor by admin.

When selecting method “Your own wallet (signable)”, a QR code dialog opens. User can scan the QR code with his WLA to check if the correct wallet is used. This step is optional and can be skipped.

Admin manages them [in cofig file](admin-user-guide/portal-configuration/features-configuration/purchase-assets-and-featured-asset.md#payment-methods-configuration).
