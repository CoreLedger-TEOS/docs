# Version 0.13

In this version we focused on redemption process refurbishment. We introduced following changes:

* now end-users will start receiving redemption details to their emails when redemption request is created
* all redemption requests are created with the redemption reference code. Admins are responsible for managing redemption reference code templates in configuration management
* some refurbishments in the steps of redemption request creation flow to make it more user-friendly

Also we fixed some bugs and introduced some architectural changes to make our solution more stable and to improve user experience.
