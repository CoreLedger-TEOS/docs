# Version 0.13

In this version we focused on redemption process refurbishment. We introduced following changes:

* now end-users will start receiving redemption details to their emails when redemption request is created
* all redemption requests are created with the redemption reference code. Admins are responsible for managing redemption reference code templates in configuration management, this is the same reference code template which is used for purchases, don't forget to adjust it to your needs as described here [#reference-code-template](../admin-user-guide/portal-configuration/features-configuration/#reference-code-template "mention")
* some refurbishments in the steps of redemption request creation flow to make it more user-friendly

Also we fixed some bugs and introduced some architectural changes to make our solution more stable and to improve user experience.
