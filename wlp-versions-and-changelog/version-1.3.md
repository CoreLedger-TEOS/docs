# Version 1.3

ðŸ‘‰ **WLP API Versioning Implemented**\
API versioning has been introduced to ensure backward compatibility and facilitate future updates. [wlp-api-documentation.md](../wlp-api-documentation.md "mention")

ðŸ‘‰ **Improved Reference Code Logic**\
New dynamic variables â€” `{year}`, `{month}`, `{day}`, `{count}` (incrementing order number) â€” allow for the generation of flexible, readable, and unique reference codes tailored to specific business needs. [reference-code-logic.md](../admin-user-guide/portal-configuration/reference-code-logic.md "mention")

ðŸ‘‰ **Login/Register Button Configuration**\
Tenant admins can now configure the Login/Register button to appear only in the sidebar or also on the feature page. This allows for testing and comparing registration conversion rates across different layouts.

ðŸ‘‰ **Enhanced Invoice Template Flexibility**\
Tenant admins can now define custom business rules within invoice templates. This enables dynamic invoice content based on asset conditions (e.g., special total calculations, dynamic bank transfer details).
