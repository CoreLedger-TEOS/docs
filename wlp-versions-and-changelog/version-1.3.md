# Version 1.3

👉 **WLP API Versioning Implemented**\
API versioning has been introduced to ensure backward compatibility and facilitate future updates.

👉 **Login/Register Button Configuration**\
Tenant admins can now configure the Login/Register button to appear only in the sidebar or also on the feature page. This allows for testing and comparing registration conversion rates across different layouts.

👉 **Enhanced Invoice Template Flexibility**\
Tenant admins can now define custom business rules within invoice templates. This enables dynamic invoice content based on asset conditions (e.g., special total calculations, dynamic bank transfer details).

👉 **Improved Reference Code Logic**\
New dynamic variables — `{year}`, `{month}`, `{day}`, `{count}` (incrementing order number) — allow for the generation of flexible, readable, and unique reference codes tailored to specific business needs.
