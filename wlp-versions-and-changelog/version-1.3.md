# Version 1.3

ðŸ‘‰ WLP API Versioning Implemented. Added API versioning to support backward compatibility.

ðŸ‘‰ Login/Register Button Configuration. Tenant admins can now choose to display the Login/Register button either only in the sidebar or also on the feature page. Helps compare registration conversion rates across different layouts.

ðŸ‘‰ Enhanced Invoice Template Flexibility. Tenant admins can define custom business rules within invoice templates. Supports dynamic invoice content based on asset conditions (e.g., special total calculations, dynamic bank transfer details).

ðŸ‘‰ Improved Reference Code Logic. New dynamic variables: {year}, {month}, {day}, {count} (incrementing order number). Enables generation of flexible, readable, and unique reference codes tailored to business needs.
