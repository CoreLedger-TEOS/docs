# Version 1.0

With this version **WLP admins and users** can try the following improvements:

👉  Added new keywords for the Redemption Template (Personal’s first name, last name, country, city, address, and zip code). You can make invoices more personalized.

👉  Rounding has been added to all flows, such as the shop and checkout flow and the redemption flow. This makes the display even simpler and more attractive for customers.

👉  Added the ability to use a decimal point in purchase amounts. Users can buy not only whole assets but also fractions of an asset. The number of digits after the decimal point is configurable.

👉  Updated the logic for configuring amounts. Amounts are configured on the user gets side when the redemption method is set to physical delivery.

👉  Added the use of unit price instead of conversion rate for the redemption flow. This makes the redemption calculation more accurate.



**We've fixed:**

* Removed the delay in updating asset data from WLM to WLP. All asset changes made in WLM are now immediately shown in WLP.
* WLP PDFs for Purchase and Redemption Templates now use the same font as in the template.
* Purchase is now possible when only the "Featured asset" is active.
* Purchase is correctly displayed for users with a direct link.
