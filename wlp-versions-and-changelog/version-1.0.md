# Version 1.0

With this version **WLP admins and users** can try the following improvements:

ðŸ‘‰  Added new keywords for the Redemption Template (Personalâ€™s first name, last name, country, city, address, and zip code). You can make invoices more personalized.

ðŸ‘‰  Rounding has been added to all flows, such as the shop and checkout flow and the redemption flow. This makes the display even simpler and more attractive for customers.

ðŸ‘‰  Added the ability to use a decimal point in purchase amounts. Users can buy not only whole assets but also fractions of an asset. The number of digits after the decimal point is configurable.

ðŸ‘‰  Updated the logic for configuring amounts. Amounts are configured on the user gets side when the redemption method is set to physical delivery.

ðŸ‘‰  Added the use of unit price instead of conversion rate for the redemption flow. This makes the redemption calculation more accurate.



**We've fixed:**

* Removed the delay in updating asset data from WLM to WLP. All asset changes made in WLM are now immediately shown in WLP.
* WLP PDFs for Purchase and Redemption Templates now use the same font as in the template.
* Purchase is now possible when only the "Featured asset" is active.
* Purchase is correctly displayed for users with a direct link.
