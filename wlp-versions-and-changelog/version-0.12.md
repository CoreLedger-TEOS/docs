# version 0.12

In this version we refurbished the order creation process to improve UX and introduced shopping cart edge cases processing to make sure you don't face any issues. Additionally we made purchase reference code available for all orders (it was available only for bank transfers till this version) and updated our recommendations how to define its template to make sure you will have around 11 mln unique codes. Now you can use it to support communication between you and your end users.

Also now admins can provide additional data necessary for your business cases for each order and redemption in order details and redemption details correspondingly.

Please, note: we renamed menu entries! Now navigation should be easier for you and your end users.

Also we fixed some bugs and introduced some design and architecture changes to improve user experience.
