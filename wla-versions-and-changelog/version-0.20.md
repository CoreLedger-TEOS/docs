# Version 0.20

Admins can decide now at the very beginning of the project how many words should be used as a seed for wallet creation. This parameter can't be configured when app is already created.

Now users can find all operations which formed the balance of the asset by tapping the asset right on the Assets screen. Check out the details here [assets-and-transactions.md](../how-your-users-interact-with-wla/assets-and-transactions.md "mention")

We brought back animation when search is in progress on Market screen. Now you can clearly see that app is still searching for the best deal to offer you.

Also we added ETH balance to the wallet information. This is ETH which is necessary for signing and writing transaction to the blockchain. ETH balance should be always enough for users within [Active Sandbox](https://coreledger.net/active-sandbox/) because service asset is distributed automatically but in case a user faces 0 balance, admins can contact CoreLedger manager to solve this problem.
