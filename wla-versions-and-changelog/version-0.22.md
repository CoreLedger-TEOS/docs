# Version 0.22

### New features

:point\_right: We've introduced the possibility to make the **signing flow more secure** for user: if you setup the app in the way that this feature is enabled, user can switch on the authentication check (pin code or biometrics based on the app settings) every time when signature is generated by the app. By default this functionality is available for users and the setting is switched on.

:point\_right:Now **invoice or payment request can be paid with other assets** which user has, not the one which is requested in the invoice or payment request. If you setup the app in the way that this feature is enabled, when user scans invoice or payment request QR code and doesn't have desired asset, he or she will be offered to search for other payment options using our warp transfer technology (yes, warp and transfer as one transaction!).

:point\_right:**French language** is now available for app users! Expand your app presence with this update.

:point\_right:We've enriched the list of **transaction types** which are supported by WLA, now all TEOS Platform transactions are nicely handled by WLA.

:point\_right:**Voting module** was introduced, though it can't be used in productive apps as is, only for your investors demonstrations

Also, as usual, we fixed some bugs to make user experience better.

### Configuration changes

{% hint style="info" %}
To support all the changes below we had to introduce versions in the config file. Please, note that ui\_config.v2.json file must be used to define WLA properties starting from v0.22 (you can find it in the blob storage). All previous versions used ui\_config.v1.json file
{% endhint %}

#### Localization

Starting from this version localization of UI strings is not available for customers by default. So, we removed links to localization files from the config file. \
But now customer can easily define default language of the app using new parameter&#x20;

```json
	"default_language": "en", //possible values: en, de, es, fr
```

All custom texts still can be localized:

* we use asset data translations defined with the help of WLM [#step-3.-translations-to-different-languages](../admin-user-guide/app-configuration/asset-configuration.md#step-3.-translations-to-different-languages "mention")
* data policy still can be localized [#data-policy](../admin-user-guide/app-configuration/additional-configuration.md#data-policy "mention")

#### Intro

We removed links to intro images from "img" section and moved full intro description to new "intro" section. Read more in [#intro](../admin-user-guide/app-configuration/additional-configuration.md#intro "mention")

```json
	"intro": {
		"img.1": "icons/intro1@3x.png", // use number to define the picture order
		"en.title.1": "Wallet", //use language code to define title in the specific language and use number to set title for the specific picture
  		"en.desc.1": "A convenient way to store and manage your digital assets/token", //use language code to define description in the specific language and use number to set description for the specific picture
		"de.title.1": "Wallet_de",
		"de.desc.1": "Description in German",
		"img.2": "icons/intro2@3x.png",
		"en.title.2": "Import token",
		"en.desc.2": "Import token from external wallets, like a Token Card",
		"de.title.1": "Import token_de",
		"de.desc.1": "Description in German",
		"img.3": "icons/intro3@3x.png",

	},
```
