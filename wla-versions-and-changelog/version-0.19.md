# version 0.19

We added new functionality for creating invoices instead of payment requests, paying them and tracking their statuses. Check how it works in [payment-request-and-invoices.md](../how-your-users-interact-with-wla/payment-request-and-invoices.md "mention")&#x20;

Now our customers can decide which functionality is necessary in the app and which not - we introduced modular based approach for WLA creation. When creating WLA based app, you can define which of those modules should be included into your app. Check [wla-modules.md](../admin-user-guide/wla-modules.md "mention")

Also we changed the flow for initiating the search for trades in decentralized market. We hope that it will help your end users reach their goals easier!&#x20;

And as usual we fixed some bugs to make the app more user friendly and stable.
