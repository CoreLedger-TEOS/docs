| Asset       | <p>An asset is something, that has a value and can be exchanged (e.g. product, service, raw materials, commodity, currency, …).</p><p>First the asset itself must be described properly, so that the customer knows what he is going to buy, what the terms are, and how he can claim/obtain the real good. He needs to know the expiry dates (think in this regard of non-durable goods such as fruits or goods, which have storage costs) and perhaps some restrictions.</p> |
