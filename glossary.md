| Asset            | <p>An asset is something, that has a value and can be exchanged (e.g. product, service, raw materials, commodity, currency, …).</p><p>First the asset itself must be described properly, so that the customer knows what he is going to buy, what the terms are, and how he can claim/obtain the real good. He needs to know the expiry dates (think in this regard of non-durable goods such as fruits or goods, which have storage costs) and perhaps some restrictions.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| Asset activation | Asset activation means, that the hash of an asset is entered in the CoreLedger contract (into the blockchain). From this point on, every change of the asset (e.g. adding information) is documented and can be tracked. Before activation, nobody else than the issuer can see, modify or even delete it. After the asset activation, sparks can be created.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| CoreLedger       | The name of our company, providing you the White Label Management Tool (WLM).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Controller       | A controller consists of addresses of different user wallets. You can add a controller to the issued assets of yours in order to limit the access to your assets to the user-wallets listed in the controller.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Definition Items | <p>The definition items serve the specification of an asset. Some definition items are mandatory by key. Before a new asset can be activated, the information must be inserted:</p><p>·       Language</p><p>·       Issuer</p><p>·       Name</p><p>·       Description</p><p>·       Jurisdiction</p><p>·       Type</p><p>·       Unit Of Measure</p><p>·       Token Unit Fraction</p><p>If more properties are required to describe an asset, additional definition items can be added. As default, the collection “general” is available with some predefined items. By selecting an item, it will be added to the form.</p>                                                                                                                                                              |
| Ethereum Address | Acts as the "account identifier". Can be compared with the IBAN number of a bank account.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Gas              | For processing of Ethereum transactions the user has to spend a certain amount of Ether (the intrinsic currency unit of the Ethereum framework) to pay for the processing costs. This cost is referred to as "Gas". If the user does not have enough Ether, then the transaction is not processed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Ledger           | A ledger is a public register of data, mostly property or transactions. In our case this term refers to the blockchain and its characteristics of reacting to a subsequent flow of transactions to change the data content of variables in a program, which runs on a decentralized distributed worldwide computing system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Signing App      | A smartphone app, to which the WLM Web app can push an unsigned transaction. The user can sign the transaction, which is subsequently broadcasted to the Ethereum network and will later appear in the WebGUI again. Also referred to as "TX.Mobile"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Spark            | Spark is the generalized term for the smallest indivisible fraction of a digital asset (like one Satoshi is for Bitcoin or one Wei is for Ether). The number of Sparks needed to get one unit of measure (kilogram, liter, token) is up to the user to decide.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Supply           | Can be compared to an offer. Someone (the owner of the supply record) offers asset token (or unit of measure amount of asset) in exchange for other asset tokens (or amount of its unit of measure) for a certain exchange rate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Tenant           | A tenant is the group of TEOS technical products (WLM , TxMobile, WLA, WLP, TEOS API) that is configurable to some extent. The tenant provides an infrastructure with the purpose of e.g. creating, buying, selling and trading assets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Spark Factor     | <p>Spark Factor, or SF, is a concept, implemented in the WLM to enable complex calculation of the asset value.</p><p>Spark factor basically says how many sparks are necessary to yield exactly one unit of measure.</p><p>Assume the asset was tungsten, its unit of measure was kilogram and the Spark factor was 1'000'000. Then one spark would represent one milligram of tungsten.</p><p>Assume that another issuer would create his own asset for tungsten, its unit of measure being "pound" and its spark factor 1'000. This would mean, that one spark actually represents 453.6 milligram of tungsten.</p><p>Unit of measure and spark factor are essential pieces of information, which an issuer has to put into the asset description, otherwise the numbers are meaningless.</p> |
| Units            | In the CoreLedger Management Tool user can decide if he sees all values of an asset in sparks or in its defined unit of measure. Therefore, he can select between the units “natural” or “sparks”.
