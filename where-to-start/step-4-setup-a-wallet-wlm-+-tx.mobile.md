# Step 4 - Setup a wallet (WLM + TX.Mobile)

In order to carry out transactions in the blockchain, you need an Ethereum address and a private key. Your Ethereum address is your public address, which can be compared to the IBAN number of a bank account (not secret). The private key is needed to sign transactions and ensures that only you can spend the assets you possess (keep secret). If you create a wallet in TX.Mobile, the public address as well as your private key are generated automatically. Moreover, for security issues your private key is stored on your mobile device only.

### Create a wallet

To create a new wallet, open the TX.Mobile app and select “Wallets”. Click on the symbol “+”. Next you can either add an existing wallet or create a new single sign wallet (Figure 9).

Let's assume you don't have any wallets yet, select “Create single sign wallet”. Name it, provide some text for the description and click “Save”. Now you should add WLM as a transaction provider to sign them with newly created wallet in TxMobile.

### Add WLM as the provider of transactions to the wallet

As this QR code is generated in the WLM, you need to open the WLM now. Please, open WLM and click on “Manage” in the wallet selector (at the top left in the menu bar).

On the top right side of this page, you will find the button “Add Wallet”. By clicking the button, a new window opens. To link your mobile wallet with the WLM, choose “Add Provider”. There, a QR code will appear.

After you scan QR code with TX.Mobile, WLM will be connected to your wallet as transaction provider. Now you can find your new wallet in the list of wallets and check its details. In the web app you will also have the same entry in “My Wallets”.
