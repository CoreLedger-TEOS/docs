# Step 1 - Create TEOS account

You can access the WLM web app via a tenant specific link. This link will be provided by the administrator of the corresponding tenant. Open the link to register. There are two possibilities to create TEOS account: use existing accounts from Google, Microsoft or Facebook, or fill out the TEOS registration form.

If you choose to sign up without using Google/Microsoft/Facebook, fill out the form, accept the data policy and terms and conditions and click on “Next” (see Figure 1).

If the sign up was successful, you will receive an email from CoreLedger. Check your mailbox for a confirmation email. In some cases, the email might be found in the spam folder. To finish the sign-up process for the web app, click on “verify e-mail” in the confirmation email. The browser opens the following page:

Starting from now you have a TEOS account which will be used in all TEOS apps and tech products.&#x20;

Next you can click “here” to continue the registration process in the app where you came from.
