# Step 5 - Start using WLM

After all 4 steps are done, you're all set to go to WLM and start using it. Normally mostly admins use WLM to manage amount of available units of assets, create new assets, manage users and etc.

If you want your WLM to be customized for your company's brand and to your needs (permissions and roles), we recommend to start by checking [admin-user-guide](../admin-user-guide/ "mention"). If your case may require end-users to use WLM, we highly recommend to customize WLM.

If you don't need customization, you can check [user-guide](../user-guide/ "mention") and go directly to the desired functionality.
